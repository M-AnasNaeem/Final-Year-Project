# User Documentation
Installation Instructions:
Step-by-Step Guide:
Follow these steps to install and set up the chatbot system on your development machine or
server:
1. Clone the Repository:
Download the chatbot project from the repository. You can use Git to clone it:
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/chatbot-project.git

2. Set Up Python Environment:
Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your machine. If not, download it from python.org.

Install the necessary Python packages via pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Set Up MySQL Database:

• Install and set up MySQL on your server or local machine.

• Create a new database (e.g., chatbot_db) and update the database
configuration in the .env file.

• Ensure the necessary tables are created by running the provided SQL scripts for
schema setup.

4. Configure Environment Variables:

• Rename the .env.example file to .env and fill in the necessary values (e.g.,
OpenAI API key, Google Cloud Translation API key, MySQL credentials).

5. Run the Flask Server:

Start the Flask application with:

flask run

The server will start, and you can access the chatbot through your web browser at
http://localhost:5000.

6. Access the Chatbot:

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000 to begin interacting with
the chatbot.

# User Instructions:
To interact with the chatbot, follow these instructions:
1. Starting the Chatbot:
Open the web interface in any modern browser.
2. Asking Questions:
Type your questions into the input field. Example queries include:

• “What is the status of my order?”

• “How can I track my shipment?”
3. Changing the Language:

• To change the language of interaction, type one of the following:

After submitting a query, the chatbot processes the information and provides a
response based on its available knowledge.
# Troubleshooting and FAQs:
1. Chatbot Not Responding:

• Possible Causes:

• The Flask server may not be running or there’s a network issue.

• Solution:

• Ensure the server is running: flask run.

• Refresh the browser and try again.

2. Incorrect Language Response:

• Possible Causes:

• The system may not have detected the language change properly.

• Solution:

• Try typing the language explicitly (e.g., “Arabic”) or rephrase the query in the
language you want.

3. Query Not Understood:

• Possible Causes:

• The chatbot may not recognize certain phrasing or unclear queries.

• Solution:

• Rephrase your question or ensure it’s more specific.

4. System Errors or Unexpected Behavior:

• Possible Causes:

• Issues with the backend server or misconfigured environment.

• Solution:

• Restart the server and check logs for errors.
# Maintenance and Updates:
To ensure the chatbot operates smoothly, regular maintenance and updates are necessary:

1. Update Dependencies:

Run the following command periodically to ensure all libraries and dependencies are
up-to-date:

pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt

2. Database Maintenance:

Regularly back up the MySQL database to ensure data integrity. You can perform
database backups using tools like mysqldump or configure automatic backups on your
server.

3. Model Updates:

If the AI model requires updates or improvements, update the OpenAI API or retrain any
custom models if necessary.

4. Bug Fixes and Patches:

As the system is used, ensure that any bugs or issues found are promptly addressed and
patched in future releases.

# Backup and Recovery:
Backup Strategy:

1. Database Backup:

• Schedule daily or weekly backups of the MySQL database to ensure no data is
lost.

• Use a tool like mysqldump for manual backups or configure automated backups
within MySQL or your cloud hosting provider.

• Store backups securely in cloud storage or on an external hard drive.

2. Codebase Backup:

• The codebase is stored in a version-controlled repository (e.g., GitHub), ensuring
code is regularly backed up.

o Regular commits and push to the remote repository ensure the latest version is
always available.

Recovery:

1. Restoring the Database:

• In case of data loss, use the most recent backup file and restore it to the MySQL
server.

mysql -u username -p chatbot_db < backup_file.sql

2. Restoring the Codebase:

• If the codebase is lost, you can clone the latest version from the Git repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repository/chatbot-project.git

3. Full System Recovery:

• If the entire system crashes, reinstall the software, restore the database from
backup, and deploy the code again.
